# MemEvolve: Architecture and System Design

## Overview

MemEvolve is a meta-evolving memory framework for agent systems that enables LLM-based agents to automatically improve their own memory architecture through dual-level evolution.

## Core Concept: Dual-Level Evolution

MemEvolve implements a **bilevel optimization** approach:

### Inner Loop — Experience Evolution
- Agents operate with a *fixed memory architecture*
- Execute tasks and accumulate experiences
- Experiences populate the memory system

### Outer Loop — Memory Architecture Evolution
- Memory system is **evaluated and redesigned**
- Architectural changes driven by empirical task feedback
- Results in progressively better memory systems

This creates a **virtuous cycle**: Better memory → better agent behavior → higher-quality experience → better memory evolution

## Formal Agent System Definition

An agentic system is formalized as:

```
M = ⟨I, S, A, Ψ, Ω⟩
```

Where:
- `I` = set of agents
- `S` = shared state space
- `A` = joint action space
- `Ψ` = environment dynamics
- `Ω` = memory module

At each timestep:
1. Agent observes state `s_t`
2. Queries memory with `(s_t, history, task)`
3. Receives retrieved context `c_t`
4. Chooses action `a_t = π(s_t, history, task, c_t)`

After task completion:
- A trajectory `τ = (s₀, a₀, …, s_T)` is recorded
- Memory state is updated with extracted experience units

## Modular Memory Design Space

To make memory evolution tractable, all memory systems are decomposed into **four orthogonal components**:

```
Ω = (Encode, Store, Retrieve, Manage)
```

### Encode
Transforms raw experience into structured representations such as lessons, skills, or abstractions.

### Store
Persists encoded information using vector databases or JSON stores.

### Retrieve
Selects task-relevant memory using semantic or hybrid strategies.

### Manage
Maintains long-term memory health via pruning, consolidation, deduplication, or forgetting.

## EvolveLab: Unified Memory Codebase

MemEvolve provides:
- A standardized abstraction for memory systems
- Four reference memory architectures defined as genotypes
- A shared MemorySystem implementation supporting configurable encoding, storage, retrieval, and management strategies
- A controlled environment for architectural evolution

## MemEvolve: Meta-Evolution Mechanism

Each memory system is treated as a **genotype** `(E, U, R, G)`.

### Evolution Steps
1. **Selection** via performance-cost Pareto ranking
2. **Diagnosis** using trajectory replay and failure analysis
3. **Design** of new variants through constrained architectural modification

## Reference Memory Architectures

Four reference memory architectures are defined as genotypes for evolutionary optimization:

| Architecture | Status | Key Features |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **AgentKB** | ✅ Defined | Static baseline genotype, lesson-based, minimal overhead |
| **Lightweight** | ✅ Defined | Trajectory-based genotype, JSON storage, auto-pruning |
| **Riva** | ✅ Defined | Agent-centric genotype, vector storage, hybrid retrieval |
| **Cerebra** | ✅ Defined | Tool distillation genotype, semantic graphs, advanced caching |

## Problem Statement

Modern LLM-based agent systems increasingly rely on **memory modules** to improve long-horizon reasoning, tool use, and task performance. However:

- Most existing **self-improving memory systems are manually designed**
- A single fixed memory architecture rarely generalizes across tasks, agent frameworks, and backbone LLMs
- Memory design choices (what to store, how to retrieve, how to manage) are often brittle and task-specific

**Key Question**: How can an agent system *not only learn from experience*, but also **meta-evolve its own memory architecture** to improve learning efficiency while retaining generalization?

## API Wrapper Layer

MemEvolve provides an optional API wrapper that transparently integrates memory functionality with existing OpenAI-compatible LLM deployments:

- **Proxy Server** - FastAPI-based server that wraps any OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
- **Memory Integration** - Automatically retrieves and injects relevant context into requests
- **Experience Encoding** - Captures and stores new interactions for future retrieval
- **Quality Scoring** - Independent, parity-based evaluation system for unbiased model assessment
- **Management Endpoints** - Additional APIs for memory inspection and management
- **Drop-in Replacement** - Applications can use MemEvolve proxy instead of direct LLM API calls

## Key Takeaways

- Memory architecture is as important as base model
- Manual memory design does not scale across tasks and domains
- Meta-evolution framework enables automatic discovery of optimal memory configurations
- Memory should be treated as a first-class system component alongside planning and tool use
- Quality scoring ensures fair evaluation across different model types and architectures
- Current implementation provides a solid foundation for empirical validation and production deployment
