**This is an API pipeline framework that proxies API requests to OpenAI compatible endpoints providing memory, memory management, and evolves the memory implementation thru mutations to enhance the memory system overtime.**

A production-ready proxy that automatically adds persistent memory to any OpenAI-compatible LLM API. Unlike other memory systems, MemEvolve continuously evolves its own architecture to optimize performance over time.

## 🎯 **Key Differentiators**

- **API Pipeline Framework**: Transparent proxy for any OpenAI-compatible LLM
- **Self-Evolving Memory**: Memory architectures that evolve through mutations
- **Zero Code Changes**: Drop-in replacement requiring no application modifications
- **Research Grounded**: Implementation based on arXiv:2512.18746 paper
- **Production Hardened**: Docker deployment, monitoring, enterprise reliability

## 🔬 Research Background

This implementation is based on the concepts introduced in the paper:

## 🌟 How It Works

### API Pipeline Flow
1. **Intercept Requests**: MemEvolve proxy receives API calls intended for your LLM service
2. **Memory Retrieval**: Queries the evolving memory system for relevant context
3. **Context Injection**: Enhances prompts with retrieved memories before forwarding to LLM
4. **Response Processing**: Captures responses and extracts new experiences for memory storage
5. **Continuous Evolution**: Background evolution system optimizes memory architecture over time

### Self-Evolution Process
- **Inner Loop**: Memory system operates and accumulates experiences from API traffic
- **Outer Loop**: Evolution framework mutates memory architectures and selects optimal configurations
- **Continuous Improvement**: System gets better at context retrieval and response enhancement automatically

## 📊 **Monitoring & Analysis Tools**

### Performance Analyzer
MemEvolve includes comprehensive monitoring tools for production deployments:

```bash
# Analyze last 24 hours of system performance
python scripts/performance_analyzer.py --days 1

# Generate detailed performance reports with actionable insights
# - API performance metrics and bottlenecks
# - Memory system efficiency and utilization
# - Evolution progress and optimization trends
# - Quality scoring analysis and recommendations
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **No LLM Dependencies** - Pure Python analysis of local logs and data
- ✅ **Actionable Insights** - Identifies performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- ✅ **Historical Analysis** - Analyze any time period from system logs
- ✅ **Automated Reporting** - Generate reports for monitoring dashboards and alerts

**See [Performance Analyzer Documentation](docs/tools/performance_analyzer.md)** for detailed usage and examples.

## 📊 Example Enhancement

**Before (Direct LLM):**
```json
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How do I debug Python memory leaks?"}]}
```

**After (With MemEvolve):**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Relevant past experiences:\n• Memory profiling with tracemalloc (relevance: 0.89)\n• GC monitoring techniques (relevance: 0.76)"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do I debug Python memory leaks?"}
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

See the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**TL;DR:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thephimart/MemEvolve-API.git
cd MemEvolve-API
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your LLM endpoint
python scripts/start_api.py
# Point your apps to http://localhost:11436/v1
```



## 📦 Installation (Detailed)

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: 3.12 or higher
- **LLM API**: Access to any OpenAI-compatible API (vLLM, Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) with embedding support
- **API Endpoints**: 1-3 endpoints (can be the same service or separate):
  - **Minimum: 1 endpoint** (must support both chat completions and embeddings)
  - **Recommended: 3 separate endpoints** for optimal performance:
    - **Upstream API**: Primary LLM service for chat completions and user interactions
    - **LLM API**: Dedicated LLM service for memory encoding and processing (can reuse upstream)
    - **Embedding API**: Service for creating vector embeddings of memories (can reuse upstream)

**Why separate endpoints?** Using dedicated services prevents distracting your main LLM with embedding and memory management tasks, while lightweight task-focused models improve efficiency and reduce latency.

### Standard Port Assignments

For consistency in examples and documentation, MemEvolve uses these standard port assignments:

| Service | Port | Environment Variable | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------------------|---------|
| **MemEvolve API** | `11436` | - | Main API proxy server |
| **Upstream LLM** | `11434` | `MEMEVOLVE_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL` | Primary chat completions |
| **Memory LLM** | `11433` | `MEMEVOLVE_MEMORY_BASE_URL` | Memory encoding/processing |
| **Embedding API** | `11435` | `MEMEVOLVE_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | Vector embeddings |

**Example:** `http://localhost:11434/v1` for upstream, `http://localhost:11433/v1` for memory LLM.

### Tested and Working Configurations

MemEvolve has been tested with the following model configurations:

**Upstream LLM** (primary chat completions):
- **llama.cpp** with GPT-OSS-20B (GGUF, MXFP4) ✅ Tested and working
- **llama.cpp** with GLM-4.6V-Flash (GGUF, Q5_K_M) ✅ Tested and working
- **llama.cpp** with Falcon-H1R-7B (GGUF, Q5_K_M) ✅ Tested and working
- **llama.cpp** with Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking (GGUF, BF16) ✅ Tested and working
- **llama.cpp** with LFM-2.5-1.2B-Instruct (GGUF, BF16) ✅ Tested and working

**Memory LLM** (encoding and processing - configured via `MEMEVOLVE_MEMORY_*` variables):
- **llama.cpp** with LFM-2.5-1.2B-Instruct (GGUF, BF16) ✅ Tested and working

**Embedding API** (vector embeddings):
- **llama.cpp** with nomic-embed-text-v2-moe (GGUF, Q5_K_M) ✅ Tested and working

*Note: The current running configuration demonstrates optimal separation of concerns with specialized models for each function: large model for chat completions, efficient model for memory processing, and dedicated embedding model.*

**Thinking/Reasoning Models**: Models with thinking/reasoning capabilities are fully supported. MemEvolve properly handles `reasoning_content` and `content` separation for memory encoding.

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thephimart/MemEvolve-API.git
cd MemEvolve-API
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API endpoints:
# - MEMEVOLVE_UPSTREAM_BASE_URL (required)
# - MEMEVOLVE_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL (auto-detected for common setups)
```



## 🏗️ How It Works

MemEvolve consists of four core memory components working together:

### Memory Pipeline
```
User Request → Memory Retrieval → LLM Processing → Response + Learning → Memory Storage
```

### Components
- **Encode**: Transforms conversations into structured memories (lessons, skills, insights)
- **Store**: Persists memories using vector databases for fast similarity search
- **Retrieve**: Finds relevant memories based on conversation context
- **Manage**: Maintains memory health through pruning and consolidation

### Evolution System (Production Ready)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ **Fully Operational**: Meta-evolution with real performance optimization
- ✅ **Evolution Cycles**: Active genotype evaluation and selection
- ✅ **Fitness Evaluation**: Meaningful differentiation between architectures
- ✅ **Performance Metrics**: Real response timing and quality scoring
- ✅ **Production Safe**: Circuit breakers, monitoring, and rollback capabilities
MemEvolve includes a functional meta-evolution framework that automatically optimizes memory architectures:
- **Implemented**: Component hot-swapping, genotype application, fitness evaluation
- **In Progress**: Safe evolution cycles (shadow mode, circuit breakers, staged rollout)
- **Architecture-Level Evolution**: Optimizes memory strategies, storage backends, retrieval methods
- **Model Constraints**: Respects fixed embedding dimensions and context windows
- **Inner Loop**: Agent operates with fixed memory system, accumulates experiences
- **Outer Loop**: Memory system architecture evolves based on empirical performance feedback
- **Result**: Self-improving memory systems that adapt to your specific use case

### API Requirements
MemEvolve needs AI services for:
- **Upstream API**: Chat completions and user interactions (e.g., llama.cpp, vLLM, OpenAI)
- **LLM API**: Encoding experiences (defaults to Upstream API if not specified)
- **Embedding API**: Vectorizing memories for semantic search (defaults to Upstream API if not specified, Upstream API must have embedding capabilities)

**Configuration Options:**
- **Single endpoint**: Use one service for everything (simplest setup)
- **Dual endpoints**: Separate chat vs memory processing (better performance)
- **Triple endpoints**: Fully dedicated services (optimal performance and specialization)

### Smart Integration
- **Context Injection**: Relevant memories added to system prompts
- **Continuous Learning**: Every interaction improves future responses
- **Automatic Management**: Memory stays optimized without manual intervention
